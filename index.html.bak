		 Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

         Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2] As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into eighty languages.[3] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.

          The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[4]

          A play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, based on a story co-written by Rowling, premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre, and its script was published by Little, Brown. The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is the third-highest-grossing film series of all time as of February 2020. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion, making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

     Harry Potter: 20th Anniversary, Back to Hogwarts...

I was such kind of a person who just watched only 1st two parts and skipped the rest, but thanks to covid for giving me the chance to watch the rest series which added love to this film forever...

Harry Potter, Ron Weasely, Hermione, Dumbledore, Profesor Snake, Lord Voldemort, these names were so popular that time and it got registered to our brains....

JK Rowling, the creator behind the Wizard Magical Fictional Movie not only encouraged to read books but also gave a limelight to the artists worked in this series which made them forever memorable in the heart of their fans... 

Amazon Prime, premiered 20th Anniversary of Harry Potter and now its streaming from 1st January 22... 

It had shown the journey of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint from nowhere to the well known stars...  ❤️
